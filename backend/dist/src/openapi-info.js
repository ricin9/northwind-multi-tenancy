## Using Query Parameters for Filtering, Pagination, and Sorting

### Pagination

Use 'page' and 'pageSize' parameters:
- page: The page number (default: 1)
- pageSize: Number of items per page (default: 10, max: 250)

    Example: ?page=2&pageSize=20
    
    ### Sorting
    Use the 'sort' parameter with field and order:
    - sort[0][field]: The field to sort by
    - sort[0][order]: The sort order ('asc' or 'desc')
   
    Example: ?sort[0][field]=productName&sort[0][order]=desc

    ### Multi-Sort
    use sort[1][field], sort[1][order] and so on.

    Example: ?sort[0][field]=productName&sort[0][order]=desc&sort[1][field]=unitPrice&sort[1][order]=asc
    ### Filtering
    Use the 'filter' parameter with various operators:
    - eq: Equal to
    - ne: Not equal to
    - lt: Less than
    - lte: Less than or equal to
    - gt: Greater than
    - gte: Greater than or equal to
    - like: SQL LIKE pattern matching
    - in: In a list of values
    - nin: Not in a list of values
    - is: Is null or not null
    
    Example: ?filter[productName][like]=%Chai%&filter[unitPrice][gte]=10
    
    You can combine multiple filters, sorting, and pagination in a single query.
    Example: ?page=1&pageSize=20&sort[0][field]=productName&sort[0][order]=asc&filter[categoryId][eq]=1&filter[unitPrice][gte]=10


    ## For javascript clients
    If your api client is written in javascript you can just use the *qs* library to stringify the filter pagination sort object and it'll just work.
